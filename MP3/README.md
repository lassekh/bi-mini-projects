#### What type/s of regression have you applied?
We have tried to find the R2 in the 3 types of regressions and found the following values based on variables:<br>
bedrooms	bathrooms	sqft_living	view	grade	sqft_above	sqft_basement	lat	sqft_living15<br>
- Linear R2: 0.641
- Multiline R2: 0.640
- Polynomial R2: 0.63

#### Which were the challenges?
The challenge is making a structured plan on how to achieve the best result. What to do with the data and which direction to take.

#### How accurate is your solution?
Based on the R2 we found as listed above we see that the solution ends up with a 64% accuracy

#### What could be done for further improvement of the accuracy?
This is another challenge to figure out what we can do to improve the accuracy. We have tried to drop more columns of the listed above and only include variables with a correlation above 0.5. That didnt even help.
